## Search Trie project
For this project I will crawl web pages, storing the resulting text in a special data structure known as a trie and using it to implement a search interface.  

Step 1: Write a Trie  data type for use in search.  
Step 2: Implement a web crawler, which will populate my Trie.  
Step 3: Implement a terminal interface using rich.


## Execution Plan:
### By the end of Week 4:
1. Complete the `character_to_key` function and write tests to verify its correctness.  
2. Ensure the function handles all specified cases (lowercase, uppercase, special characters).
### By the end of Week 5:
1. Implement the Trie class with all required methods and the `wildcard_search` function.  
2. Write tests to verify the trie's functionality, including edge cases.
### By the end of Week 6:
1. Build the web crawler to collect words from specified URLs and populate the trie.  
2. Test the crawler to ensure it respects `max_depth` and avoids infinite loops.  
### By the end of Week 7:
1. Implement the search interface (terminal or web) to query the trie and display results.  
2. Ensure the interface is user-friendly and supports continuous searching.  
### By the end of Week 8:
1. Conduct final testing and refine the system for performance and usability.  
2. Add error handling and user-friendly messages.  
3. Prepare the project for submission.
